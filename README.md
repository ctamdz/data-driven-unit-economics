# Unit Economics Analysis for a SaaS Company

## The Story Behind the Numbers

This is a project to analyze the actual business situation of a SaaS software company. Instead of just looking at revenue, we dig deeper to see if customer acquisition and retention is actually profitable.

## What We Found

### The Real Numbers:

- **Cost to Acquire a New Customer**: $1,213.97
- **Average Revenue Per Customer**: $284.36
- **Total Value Per Customer**: $2,115.52
- **LTV/CAC Ratio**: 1.74x
- **Gross Profit Margin**: 75.60%
- **Average Customer Lifetime**: 9.84 Months

### The Real Situation
The company is in a state of concern. Why? Because to get $2,115 from a customer, they have to spend $1,213 to acquire it. That’s only a 1.74x ratio, while healthy SaaS companies typically have a ratio of over 3x.

However, there’s some good news: the gross profit margin of 75.60% is impressive, showing that the company knows how to operate efficiently.

## Why These Metrics Matter

### CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) - Customer Acquisition Cost
This is the amount of money a company has to spend to acquire a new customer. It includes sales/marketing staff salaries, advertising costs, and tools like Salesforce.

### ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) - Average Revenue Per User
This tells you how much money an average customer contributes each month. The higher the number, the better.

### LTV (Customer Lifetime Value) - Customer Lifetime Value
The total amount of money a customer brings in during the entire time of using the service. Calculated by: usage time × monthly revenue × profit rate.

### Gross Margin - Gross profit margin
After deducting direct operating costs (technical staff salaries, servers, software), how much percentage of revenue is left?

### LTV/CAC ratio
This is the most important index. It shows: "For every dollar spent to attract customers, how much money do we get back?"

- Below 1: Losing money with each customer
- 1-3: Profitable but small (current: 1.74)
- 3-5: Good
- Above 5: Excellent

## What to do now

### High priority (do it now):

**Reduce customer acquisition costs:**
- Focus on the most effective marketing channels
- Improve website and sales process
- Increase visitor-to-customer conversion rate

**Increase customer value:**
- Build a better customer care program
- Reduce customer churn rate
- Develop premium service packages

### Medium-term plan:

- Build a customer health tracking system
- Create features that make it difficult for customers to leave
- Develop additional products to sell to existing customers

## Data used

This analysis is based on real-world data from 5 main sources:

1. **Monthly Expenses**: All expenses from marketing to stationery
2. **Payroll**: All employees' salaries by department
3. **Marketing Spend**: Advertising on different channels
4. **Customer Invoices**: Payment history and new customers
5. **Customer Lifecycle**: Time from start to stop

All data has been processed for security and is for educational purposes only.

## Summary Table

| Metrics | Results | Industry Benchmarks | Comments |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| LTV/CAC | 1.74x | Needs > 3.0x | Needs Improvement |
| Gross Margin | 75.60% | Needs > 70% | Excellent |
| ARPU | $284.36 | Depends on Service | Good |
| Service duration | 9.84 months | Recommended > 12 months | Could be better |

## Technology used

Analysis was performed using Python with the following libraries:

- **Pandas**: For data processing and calculations

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For visual presentation of results

- **Google Sheets**: Primary data source

## Conclusion

This company has a huge strength in operating efficiently (high gross margin), but is struggling to attract customers profitably.

If they can reduce marketing costs or increase customer retention, the situation will improve significantly. The goal is to achieve a LTV/CAC ratio of at least 3.0 to achieve sustainable growth.
